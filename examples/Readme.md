Your parking gargage class should have the following methods:
- takeTicket
    - This should decrease the amount of tickets available by 1
    - This should decrease the amount of parkingSpaces available by 1
- payForParking
    - Display an input that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable
    - If the payment variable is not empty then (meaning the ticket has been paid) ->  display a message to the user that their ticket has been paid, and they have 15mins to leave
    - This should update the "currentTicket" dictionary key "paid" to True
      -leaveGarage
    - If the ticket has been paid, display a message of "Thank You, have a nice day"
    - If the ticket has not been paid, display an input prompt for payment
        - Once paid, display message "Thank you, have a nice day!"
    - Update parkingSpaces list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the parkingSpaces list)
    - Update tickets list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the tickets list)

You will need a few attributes as well:
- tickets -> list
- parkingSpaces -> list
- currentTicket -> dictionary
